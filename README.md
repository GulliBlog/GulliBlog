- 👋 Hi, 
- 👉 this is my Gulli "Blog".


👀 What will you find here?  
Some random and uncategorizable stuff that i found.

GulliBlog is a
- 📖 diary with trash stories ..
- 📝 notepad with useless stuff ..
- 🔗 collection of random WWW-Links ..  

.. that might never interest anyone, but who cares?
  
    
I use github to long-term save this stuff.  
And yes, I know Github is not meant to be used that way.
